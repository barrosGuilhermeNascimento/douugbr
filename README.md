# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Douglas and I'm a software developer.

### Bio

My name is Douglas Silva, also known as douugbr online, I'm 17 y/o and I'm a self-taught dev. I started coding not long ago but always wanted to, you know? Nowadays I'm full-stack python dev currently and also a graphic designer (so I got a decent UI/UX knowledge even though I never really studied any of it). I still have a passion for game design and sure will learn it at the future.
