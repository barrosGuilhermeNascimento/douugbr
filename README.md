### Bio

My name is Douglas "douugbr" Silva, I'm 17 y/o. I'm a freelancer full-stack python dev currently, but also got some jobs with graphic design for social media, video animations and basic compositing (so I got a decent UI/UX knowledge even though I never really studied any of it). I still have a passion for game design and sure will learn it at the future.
